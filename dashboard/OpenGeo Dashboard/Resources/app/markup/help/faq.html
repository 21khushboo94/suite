      <p>Please visit our website at <a href="http://opengeo.org" class="app-xlink">opengeo.org</a>.  You can also visit each community project's homepage: <a href="http://postgis.org" class="app-xlink">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://geoserver.org" class="app-xlink">GeoServer</a>, <a href="http://geowebcache.org" class="app-xlink">GeoWebCache</a>, <a href="http://openlayers.org" class="app-xlink">OpenLayers</a>, and <a href="http://geoext.org" class="app-xlink">GeoExt</a>.  We also encourage those interested in a particular project to join that project's mailing list to interact with the wider community.</p>
      <h1>How do I file a bug report?</h1>
      <p>If you are on an Enterprise Edition (either trial or full contract) please email <strong>help@opengeo.org</strong> or submit to our <a href="http://opengeo.org/support" class="app-xlink">support page</a>.  Community Edition users should file reports with the components' open source projects, according to their conventions.</p>
      <h1>Is PostGIS a part of the OpenGeo Suite?</h1>
      <p>Yes.  This software natively supports and connects to existing PostGIS databases.  Future versions of this software will include PostGIS.</p>
      <h1>Does the OpenGeo Suite support connections with ArcSDE databases?</h1>
      <p>Yes, however there are certain required files that we are not allowed to redistribute.  To enable ArcSDE support, copy jsde*.jar and jpe*.jar from your ArcSDE installation into the installation directory under "webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib" and restart.  You should then see ArcSDE as an option in GeoServer.</p>
      <h1>Does the OpenGeo Suite support connections with Oracle Spatial databases?</h1>
      <p>Yes, however there are certain required files that we are not allowed to redistribute.  To enable Oracle Spatial support, copy ojdbc*.jar from your Oracle installation into the installation directory under "webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib" and restart.  You should then see Oracle as an option in GeoServer.</p>
      <h1>How do I start the OpenGeo Suite?</h1>
      <p>There are a few ways to start the OpenGeo Suite.  The simplest way is through the Dashboard, by clicking the Start button on the bottom right on the page.  You can also manually start and stop the suite by running the "opengeo-suite" script in the root of your application directory.</p>
      <h1>Why can't I start the OpenGeo Suite?</h1>
      <p>The most common reason why the OpenGeo Suite is unable to start is because of a port conflict.  By default, the OpenGeo Suite runs on port 8080 of the host machine, and if another service using that port, the Suite will not run.  To change the OpenGeo Suite port, go to the <a href="#app-panels-pref-main" class="app-ilink">Preferences</a> page, change the Primary Port, click Save, then restart the OpenGeo Suite.  If you are still unable to start the service, you may want to check the <a href="#app-panels-help-logs" class="app-ilink">Logs</a> for other errors.  If you are still unable to find your answer, please contact us at our <a href="http://opengeo.org/support" class="app-xlink">support page</a> or email <strong>help@opengeo.org</strong> with a description of your issue.</p>
      <h1>How do I change the port that the OpenGeo Suite runs on?</h1>
      <p>By default, the OpenGeo Suite runs on port 8080 of the host machine.  To change the OpenGeo Suite port, go to the <a href="#app-panels-pref-main" class="app-ilink">Preferences</a> page, change the Primary Port, click Save, then restart the OpenGeo Suite.</p>
      <h1>How do I make sense of these logs?</h1>
      <p>Many Java errors are very long and span multiple lines (all usually being with the word "at ...").  Usually the first line of the error is where the human-readable content is.  You may have to scroll up to find the error you're looking for.</p>
      <h1>Where is my GeoServer data directory?</h1>
      <p>Your GeoServer data directory is located inside your user's home directory at ".opengeo/data_dir".</p>
      <h1>Why did I get a Java stack trace with GeoServer on my web browser?</h1>
      <p>Java stack traces can happen for many reasons, ranging from incorrect requests to software bugs.  The first lines of the stack trace normally have the most helpful information.  If you are unable to discern to particular error you're receiving, please copy it into an email and send it to <strong>help@opengeo.org</strong> or submit to our <a href="http://opengeo.org/support" class="app-xlink">support page</a>.</p>
      <h1>How do I add lots of data to the OpenGeo Suite at once?</h1>
      <p>The OpenGeo Suite includes a <a href="#app-geoserver_importer" class="app-xlink app-online">Layer Importer</a> as an extension to GeoServer that allows for batch loading of database tables and shapefiles.</p>
      <h1>Why is my OpenLayers map blank (or pink)?</h1>
      <p>You may wish to look at the Error Console for your browser, or even better, use a JavaScript debugger.  If using Mozilla Firefox, a popular debugger is <a href="http://getfirebug.org" class="app-xlink">Firebug</a>. </p>
      <h1>Does Styler include all of the functionality contained in the SLD spec?</h1>
      <p>Styler includes most common uses contained in the SLD specification.  Certain extras, such as vendor options, are not preserved.  If unsure about editing an existing SLD file with Styler, please make a backup first.</p>
      <h1>Why are my vendor options are not rendered when I view an existing SLD in Styler?</h1>
      <p>Styler does not recognize vendor options, which are not part of the SLD specification.</p>
      <h1>How do I increment the bookmark number in GeoExplorer?</h1>
      <p>The bookmark number increments automatically when you create a new map.</p>
