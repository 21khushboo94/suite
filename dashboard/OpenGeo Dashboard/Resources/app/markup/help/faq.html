      <h3>How do I file a bug report?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>How do I start/stop the OpenGeo Suite?</h3>
      <p>There are a few ways to start the OpenGeo Suite.  The simplest way is through the Dashboard, by clicking the Start/Stop button on the bottom right.  You can also manually start and stop the suite from the command line by typing "opengeo-suite start" or "opengeo-suite stop" in the root of your application directory.</p>

      <h3>Why can't I start the OpenGeo Suite?</h3>
      <p>The most common reason why the OpenGeo Suite is unable to start is because of a port conflict.  By default, the OpenGeo Suite web applications run on port 8080 of the host machine, and if another service using that port, the Suite will not run.  To change this port, go to the <a href="#app-panels-pref-main" class="app-ilink">Preferences</a> page, change the Primary Port, click Save, then restart the OpenGeo Suite.  If you are still unable to start the service, you may want to check the <a href="#app-panels-help-logs" class="app-ilink">Logs</a> for other errors.  If you are still unable to find your answer, please visit the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/opengeo" class="app-xlink">OpenGeo Suite Community Forum</a> and describe your issue and the steps you've taken to resolve it.</p>

      <h3>How do I change the port that the OpenGeo Suite web applications run on?</h3>
      <p>By default, the OpenGeo Suite web applications run on port 8080 of the host machine.  To change this port, go to the <a href="#app-panels-pref-main" class="app-ilink">Preferences</a> page, change the Primary Port, click Save, then restart the OpenGeo Suite.</p>

      <h3>How do I make sense of the logs?</h3>
      <p>Many Java errors are very long and span multiple lines (all usually being with the word "at ...").  Usually the first line of the error is where the human-readable content is (and it usually is the line that does not contain the "at ...").  You may have to scroll up to find the error you're looking for.</p>

      <h3>How do I join the open source communities?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>Where can I get training for the OpenGeo Suite</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>How often are new versions of the OPenGeo Suite released?</h3>
      <p>We anticipate releasing a new Enterprise Edition every 4-6 months, with a new Community Edition slightly more often.</p>

      <h3>Can I upgrade to a new version and retain all of my data/settings?</h3>
      <p>Yes.  Simply download and run the newest installer, and your settings will be preserved.</p>

      <h3>How can I be notified of new features, releases, and other news regarding the OpenGeo Suite?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>How do I request or support a new feature that is on OpenGo Suite roadmap?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>Can I run the OpenGeo Suite on my mobile phone?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>PostGIS</h2>

      <h3>Is PostGIS a part of the OpenGeo Suite?</h3>
      <p>Yes.  This software includes PostGIS, for a complete geospatial software stack.</p>

      <h3>How do I know postgis is running?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>How can view/edit my PostGIS database</h3>
      <p>The OpenGeo Suite includes PgAdmin, a desktop-based graphical database management application.  Click on the <a href="#app-postgis_path" class="app-xlink app-online">Manage PostGIS</a> link in the Dashboard to run PgAdmin.</p>

      <h3>What port is PostGIS running on?</h3>
      <p>By default, PostGIS is running on port 54321.</p>

      <h3>Can I run the OpenGeo Suite if I already have PostGIS installed? </h3>
      <p>Yes.  By deafult, PostGIS installations run on port 5432, but the PostGIS database included with the OpenGeo Suite runs on port 54321.  As long as these port numbers are different, there should be no conflicts.</p>

      <h3>How do I load a shapefile into PostGIS when I don't know its projection?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>Can I convert a directory of shapefiles to PostGIS tables?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>How do I know if the OpenGeo Suite is running?</h3>
      <p>You can see the status of the OPenGeo Suite in the home page of the Dashboard.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to uninstall this version before upgrading to a newer version? </h3>
      <p>No.  Simply download and run the newest installer, and your settings will be preserved.</p>

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>GeoServer</h2>

      <h3>Does the GeoServer support connections with ArcSDE or Oracle Spatial databases?</h3>
      <p>Yes, however there are certain required files that must be manuall copied from your own ArcSDE/Oracle installation.   The files required for ArcSDE are <code>jsde*.jar</code> and <pre>jpe*.jar</pre> from your ArcSDE installation.  The files required for Oracle Spatial is <code>ojdbc*.jar</code> from your Oracle installation.  Copy the required file(s) into the installation directory under "webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib" and restart.  You should then see ArcSDE/Oracle as an option in GeoServer.</p>

      <h3>Where is my GeoServer data directory?</h3>
      <p>Your GeoServer data directory is located inside your user's home directory at ".opengeo/data_dir".</p>

      <h3>Why did I get a Java stack trace with GeoServer in my web browser?</h3>
      <p>Java stack traces can happen for many reasons, ranging from incorrect requests to software bugs.  The first lines of the stack trace normally have the most helpful information.  If you are unable to discern the particular error you're receiving, please the entire error into a problem request at the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/opengeo" class="app-xlink">OpenGeo Suite Community Forum</a>.  Please describe what you were doing immediately prior to the error occurring, as well as your operating system, software version, and other relevant information.</p>

      <h3>How do I add lots of data to GeoServer at once?</h3>
      <p>The OpenGeo Suite includes a <a href="#app-geoserver_importer" class="app-xlink app-online">Layer Importer</a> as an extension to GeoServer that allows for batch loading of PostGIS database tables and shapefiles.</p>

      <h3>Can I run the OpenGeo Suite if I already have GeoServer installed? </h3>
      <p>Yes, however GeoServer runs on port 8080 by default.  If you already have another GeoServer instance running on port 8080, the OpenGeo Suite will not start properly, so you will need to change the port that GeoServer runs on.  To change this port, go to the <a href="#app-panels-pref-main" class="app-ilink">Preferences</a> page, change the Primary Port, click Save, then restart the OpenGeo Suite.</p>

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>GeoWebCache</h2>

      <h3>Where can I configure GeoWebCache?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>OpenLayers</h2>

      <h3>Why is my OpenLayers map blank (or pink)?</h3>
      <p>Blank/pink maps in OpenLayers are usually caused by either a JavaScript error, or an invalid connection to a web service.  You may wish to look at the Error Console for your browser, or even better, use a JavaScript debugger.  If using Mozilla Firefox, a popular debugger is <a href="http://getfirebug.org" class="app-xlink">Firebug</a>.</p>

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>GeoExt</h2>

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>Styler</h2>

      <h3>Does Styler include all of the functionality contained in the SLD spec?</h3>
      <p>Styler includes the most commonly used tags contained in the SLD specification, but does not attain 100% compatibility.  Certain extras, such as GeoServer vendor options, are not supported or preserved.  If you are unsure about editing an existing SLD file with Styler, please make a backup first.</p>

      <h3>Why are my vendor options are not rendered when I view an existing SLD in Styler?</h3>
      <p>Styler does not recognize or preserve GeoServer vendor options, which are not part of the SLD specification.  If you are unsure about editing an existing SLD file with Styler, please make a backup first.</p>

      <h3>Why is Styler blank, with no layers in the layer pane?</h3>
      <p>This is often caused by a corrupt layer entry in GeoServer.  You may wish to delete and reload any recent layers or layer groups.  Also,  the <a href="#app-panels-help-logs" class="app-ilink">Logs</a> may have more detailed information.

      <h3>Q?</h3>
      <p>A.</p>

    <h2>GeoExplorer</h2>

      <h3>How do I increment the bookmark number in GeoExplorer?</h3>
