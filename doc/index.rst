GeoExplorer is a JavaScript application for building browser-based geospatial applications in a browser.  It is designed to have the match the look, feel, and functionality of desktop clients.  Quickly assemble rich mapping applications from multiple :term:`OGC` Web Mapping Services (:term:`WMS`) with GeoExplorer, and embed your finished map in any web page.

Built with `GeoExt <http://geoext.org>`_, GeoExplorer is currently under development and will eventually integrate the design components of **Styler** and  editing capabilities of **GeoEditor** for a complete web-mapping framework.
