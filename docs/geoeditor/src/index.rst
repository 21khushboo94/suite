===========

GeoEditor is a Javascript framework for creating and editing geographic features without sacrificing data integrity.  The GeoEditor toolset for modifying simple and multi points, lines, and polygons, as well as text and geometry collections minimizes the cost of data development and maintenance. Built upon the latest GeoExt features, GeoEditor will eventually merge with the design and composition capabilities of Styler and GeoExplorer.
