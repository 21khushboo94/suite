Editing Data
============

With your dataset prepared, you are now ready to modify vector features and/or attribute information. The basic workflow for editing data includes:

Choose whether you want to create new features or modify an existing one.
Add or edit attributes of the feature.
Save edits and stop editing.

Creating a New Feature
----------------------

One of the most common editing tasks is to create new features. 

To start, select the :guilabel:`Create a new feature` tool from the Tools panel.  With this tool you can draw a *draft* geometry of line, point, polygon as well a vertices at intersections or midpoint.  A draft is composed of all the vertices or anchor points of a feature.   

To add vertices, position your pointer within the Map window and click. For point geometries, a single click will create a point feature.  

For lines and polygon geometries, continue positioning vertices with a single click.  To complete a feature draft double click your mouse.  The positioned vertices will create a feature of the same geometry type.

By default, the :guilabel:`Create a new feature` tool changes to the :guilabel:`Edit existing feature` tool.
