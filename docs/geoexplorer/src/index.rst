GeoExplorer
===========

GeoExplorer is an web application for composing and publishing maps.  Quickly assemble maps from GeoServer or any :term:`OGC` Web Mapping Server (:term:`WMS`) and integrate with hosted maps such as Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.  You can embed maps composed in GeoExplorer in any web page.  You can also print your maps by outting them in PDF format.

GeoExplorer is built using the :term:`GeoExt` framework.
