.. _geoexplorer.using.add:Add Layers==========The first step when using GeoExplorer is to add layers.Click on the :guilabel:`Add Layers` button in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel` to display the :guilabel:`Available Layers` dialog, where you can select the layers you wish to add to GeoExplorer... figure:: images/add_button.png   :align: center   *Add Layers button in the Layers Panel toolbar*.. figure:: images/add_dialog.png   :align: center   *Add Layers dialog*This dialog shows all of the layers served through your local instance of GeoServer.  (If running GeoExplorer as a standalone module, GeoExplorer will instead display layers from a remote GeoServer by default.)  For each layer, the layer Name and Title is displayed.  Layer Abstract (description) can be displayed by clicking on the plus icon for each layer... figure:: images/add_abstract.png   :align: center   *Showing the description (abstract) for a layer*Select layers by clicking them.  Shift-clicking will select multiple contiguous layers, while Ctrl/Cmd-clicking will select multiple non-contiguous layers.  Click the :guilabel:`Add Layers` button to add those layers to the map.  When done, click :guilabel:`Done`.  You should now see your layers in the Overlays folder in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel`... figure:: images/add_layersadded.png   :align: center   *Layers added to the map as overlays*GeoExplorer doesn't automatically zoom to your newly added layers.  If you don't see your layers, select a layer, then and click the :guilabel:`Zoom to layer extent` button in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.toolbar`.  You can also right-click on a specific layer and select :guilabel:`Zoom to layer extent`.  In addition, you can manually zoom to the desired area by using the zoom and pan buttons in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow`.Default servers---------------There are four servers that GeoExplorer initially recognizes.  These serves each contain a list of available layers.    .. list-table::       :header-rows: 1       :widths: 20 40 40        * - Server Name         - Description         - Notes       * - **Local GeoServer**         - Local GeoServer WMS, if present on the same server as GeoExplorer.         - Not available when using the standalone version of GeoExplorer.       * - **Remote Suite GeoServer**         - GeoServer WMS on OpenGeo's servers.         - GeoServer URL is: ``http://v2.suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/``       * - **OpenStreetMap Layers**         - Layers served through `OpenStreetMap <http://openstreetmap.org>`_.         - Available layers:              * :guilabel:`Mapnik`             * :guilabel:`Tiles@Home`       * - **Google Layers**         - Layers served through `Google Maps <http://maps.google.com>`_.         - Available layers:              * :guilabel:`Google Roadmap`             * :guilabel:`Google Satellite`             * :guilabel:`Google Hybrid`             * :guilabel:`Google Terrain`To view/add layers from one of these servers, select the server name from the :guilabel:`View available data from:` box... figure:: images/add_availableservers.png   :align: center   *Available servers*Connect to another WMS----------------------To load layers from a server not listed above, you will need to add it to the list of available servers first.  You can add any valid :term:`WMS`.To add a new server, click on :guilabel:`Add a New Server` in the :guilabel:`Available Layers` dialog box.  A small window will pop up, where a WMS service URL can be entered.You can enter a URL to a server's WMS endpoint, or to a WMS :term:`GetCapabilities` request.  An example URL of a WMS endpoint would be::  http://demo.opengeo.org/geoserver/wmsAn example URL of a WMS GetCapabilities request would be::  http://demo.opengeo.org/geoserver/wms?service=wms&version=1.1.1&request=getcapabilitiesEither of the above URLs would result in the same list of layers.An example of a non-GeoServer WMS GetCapabilities request would::  http://terraservice.net/ogccapabilities.ashx?version=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities.. figure:: images/add_newserver.png   :align: center   *Adding a new WMS server*Once the server has been added to the list, any layers listed can be added to GeoExplorer as described above.Ordering--------Once layers have been added to GeoExplorer, you can reorder the layers to affect the rendering order.  To change the order of layers, click and drag the layers in the Overlays list in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel`.  The layers will be rendered in the order in which they are listed, which means that the layer at the top of the list will display on the top of all of the other layers, the next layer will be drawn below that, etc.  The selected base layer will always be drawn first (i.e. beneath all other layers)... figure:: images/add_draglayers.png   :align: center   *Reordering Layers*
