The OpenGeo Suite runs a web server that reponds on a specific port (the default is **8080**).  You can change this by going to the Preferences page and changing the :guilabel:`Port` value.  Click :guilabel:`Save` when done.

You can also point the OpenGeo Suite to a different GeoServer data directory.  You can change the path by going to the Preferences page and changing the value of :guilabel:`Data Directory`.  Click :guilabel:`Save` when done.

.. note:: You must stop and start the OpenGeo Suite for your changes to take effect.
