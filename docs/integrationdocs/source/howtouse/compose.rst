Step 3: Compose Your Map
========================

Now that the data is imported and styled, you can organize and compose your layers into a map.  **GeoExplorer** allows you to create web maps based on layers served through GeoServer.

#. Run GeoExplorer.  You can do this by selecting :guilabel:`GeoExplorer` in the Dashboard or by navigating to :menuselection:`Start Menu --> Programs --> OpenGeo Suite --> GeoExplorer`.

      *GeoExplorer*

#. You will see a basemap of the world.  To add your layers on top of this basemap, click on the :guilabel:`Add Layers` button (a green circle with a white plus) in the top left corner of the screen.

      *This button will bring up the Add Layers dialog*

#. A list of layers from GeoServer will be displayed.  Select the layers you wish to add, then click :guilabel:`Add layers`.  (You can Ctrl-click to select multiple layers.)  Click :guilabel:`Done` when finished.

   .. note:: You can also add layers served through another remote GeoServer, or any other compatible Web Map Server (WMS).  Click the :guilabel:`Add a new server` button to connect to another server.
