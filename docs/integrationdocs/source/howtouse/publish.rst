Step 4: Publish Your Map
========================

After you have created and composed your map in **GeoExplorer**, you can save it via a URL bookmark.  The URL can also be embedded in a web page.

URL Bookmark

To generate a URL bookmark:

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Save Map` icon.

   .. figure:: img/savemap.png
      :align: center

      *The Bookmark button will generate a URL*

#. A URL will be displayed.  Copy and save this URL to regenerate this map at a later time.

Embedded Map
------------

To embed your map in a web page:

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Publish Map` icon.

   .. figure:: img/publishmap.png
      :align: center

      *The Publish Map button will generate a block of HTML*

#. A dialog will show HTML code that can be copied and included in a web page in order to embed the map.  You can change the values for the map size in the :guilabel:`Map Size` pulldown boxes, or by changing the :guilabel:`Height` and :guilabel:`Width` values.  The changes will automatically be reflected in the HTML.
