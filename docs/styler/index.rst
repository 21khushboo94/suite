Styler brings the power of desktop GIS styling to the web, providing an easy to use GUI to customize how your maps look online.  Styler allows users to make maps with the look and feel their applications need.  By abstracting traditional GIS styling components, and adding an easy-to-use web interface, designing maps no longer hinges upon tedious XML coding.  Styler's framework in conjunction with the Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) XML language, provides rapid prototyping and viewing of styles. Built entirely with Javascript, leveraging the OpenLayers and GeoExt libraries, Styler's emphasis on open standards and flexible design makes designing the map you want easy and more efficient.  Styler is currently under development and will eventually be an integrated component of the GeoExplorer application.
