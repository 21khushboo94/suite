Creating application plugins for the Client SDK
===============================================


This tutorial will show how to add additional functionality to applications built through the OpenGeo Suite SDK, in the form of **plugins**.  Plugins (also known as tools) can have actions and/or output. Three examples will be shown:

* Plugin with only an action, no output
* Plugin with only an output, no action
* Plugin with a combination of action and output
 
These examples will be based around the case of a user drawing a box on the map and getting information about that box.

For more information on the OpenGeo Suite SDK, please see the section on :ref:`apps.sdk.client.dev`.
