Creating application plugins for the Client SDK
===============================================


This tutorial will show how to add additional functionality to applications built through the :ref:`OpenGeo Suite SDK <apps.sdk.client.dev>`, in the form of **plugins**.  Plugins (also known as tools) can have actions and/or output.  An action refers to a button or a menu item, while an output refers to something visible on the screen like a popup or a panel.

Three examples will be shown:

* Plugin with an action
* Plugin with an output
* Plugin with a combination of action and output

These examples will be based around the case of a user drawing boxes on the map and getting information about those boxes.
