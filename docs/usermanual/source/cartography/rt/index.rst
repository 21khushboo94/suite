Rendering Transformations
=========================

**Rendering Transformations** are a feature in GeoServer 
that allow creating sophisticated, dynamic visualizations of geospatial data.
Rendering transformations are defined in an SLD style,
and allow transforming input data into 
a more effective format for visualization.
A good overview is provided in the Geoserver User Guide section on 
Rendering Transformations.

This section describes how to use some of the most powerful 
rendering transformations.
