Web map styling with YSLD
=========================

YSLD is the styling language used for maps created with OpenGeo Suite Composer. It is equivalent in functionality to Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD), a serialization markup language used internally by GeoServer, while providing a much simpler markup. In fact, YSLD runs directly on the same GeoServer engine, and is not "converted" into SLD prior to use (as is done by the CSS Styling extension for GeoServer and OpenGeo Suite).

This section will discuss using YSLD in OpenGeo Suite.
