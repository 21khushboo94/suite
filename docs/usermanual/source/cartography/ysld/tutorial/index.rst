For this tutorial, you will need to download the following files from the `Natural Earth dataset <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/>`_:

 * `10m Populated Places <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_populated_places.zip>`_
 * `10m Roads <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_roads.zip>`_
 * `10m Countries <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip>`_

Also download the following file from the `Natural Earth III extra data <http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/extra.html>`_:

 * `Large grayscale DEM <http://naturalearth.springercarto.com/ne3_data/dem_large.zip>`_

These four files should be imported into Composer as new layers. The following pages will demonstrate how to style each of these layers to compose a map.

The tutorial is divided into five steps. The first four steps will style each of the layers individually, and then the final step will be to compose the finished map.
