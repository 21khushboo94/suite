Maps
====

Now that we have a set of styled layers, we can bring them together as a map.
In the Composer, create a new map with the four layers you have styled.

You will now have a map that draws these four layers on top of each other. You can order layers by dragging them. Ensure the layers are ordered as point, line, polygon, and raster. This will produce a map that looks like:

.. figure:: img/map_zoom_1.png

.. figure:: img/map_zoom_2.png

.. figure:: img/map_zoom_3.png
