Layer Importer
==============

The OpenGeo Suite bundles a powerful Layer Importer with GeoServer. The importer is an alternative to the standard loading options in GeoServer, which makes it easier to load and publish whole directories of shapefiles and GeoTIFFs, PostGIS tables, and even Oracle and SQL Server tables.

You can access the Layer Importer through the GeoServer Web Interface, or programmatically through the importer REST interface. This section will show you how to work with the Importer.
