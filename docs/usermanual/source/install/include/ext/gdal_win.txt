GDAL install for Windows

1. From the ext zip, windows dir, GDAL-suite4.9-windows.zip, Extract All...  into a directory (C:\\GDAL)
2. Add :file:`C:\\GDAL` to your path

        .. include:: /install/windows/include/updatePATH.txt
        
3. Verify install by opening :guilabel:`Command Prompt` and running  :guilabel:`gdalinfo --formats`
     
     Should see a big list of formats
     
4. Tomcat Config, :guilabel:`Java` :guilabel:`Java Options`
     Add "-Djava.library.path=C:\GDAL" and Apply changes
