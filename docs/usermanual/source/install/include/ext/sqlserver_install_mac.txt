To install :ref:`SQL Server <intro.extensions.sqlserver>` support in GeoServer, you will need to copy some files to the proper location. The files to be copied are inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (:file:`BoundlessSuite-ext.zip`).

#. Inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle, navigate to the :file:`sqlserver` directory.

#. Copy the contents of the :file:`sqlserver` directory into the library directory (:file:`WEB-INF/lib`) of your GeoServer instance. For example, if your GeoServer application is located at :file:`/Library/Tomcat/webapps/geoserver`, copy the files to :file:`/Library/Tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib`.

Because of licensing issues, **an additional file is required to be installed**.

#. Copy :file:`sqljdbc.jar` from the SQL Server installation media to the same directory specified above.

#. Restart the server.
