These instructions provide a **virtual machine** which has been already configured with Boundless Suite, eliminating the need to install Boundless Suite directly on your machine.

**All interaction with Boundless Suite will still be done through your host's standard browser or a terminal connection.** There is no need to interact directly with the virtual machine console once it is running.

This virtual machine is designed to run inside `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org>`_.
