Some Geoserver extensions require non-java (binary) support libraries.  

GDAL
~~~~

#. Install, from the Boundless Repository, the GDAL and GDAL-java packages.

    On RedHat:

	    .. code-block:: bash

	      yum install gdal gdal-java

	On ubuntu:

	    .. code-block:: bash

	      apt-get install libgdal libgdal-java 


#. Verify the GDAL install by running :file:`gdalinfo --formats` to see a long list of supported formats and :file:`gdalinfo --version` to verify the version (1.11.2).  Also verify that the :file:`gdal.jar` file is in :file:`/usr/share/java`

#. Copy the :file:`gdal.jar` from :file:`/usr/share/java` into the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your Geoserver web application.

#. Copy the :file:`.jar` files from the :file:`gdal` directory inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (available from Boundless Connect) into the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your Geoserver web application.

#. In your Tomcat config, make sure that :guilabel:`-Djava.library.path` includes the gdal and gdal-jni libaries - :file:`/usr/lib64`,  :file:`/usr/lib`, :file:`/usr/lib/jni`.

#. In your Tomcat config, create a :guilabel:`GDAL_DATA` environment variable that points to :file:`/usr/share/gdal`

NetCDF-4 Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install, from the Boundless Repository, the NetCDF package.

    On RedHat:

	    .. code-block:: bash

	      yum install netcdf

	On ubuntu:

	    .. code-block:: bash

	      apt-get install netcdf-bin

#. Verify the NetCDF install by running :file:`ncdump` to verify the version (4.3.3.1)

#. In your Tomcat config, make sure that :guilabel:`-Djna.library.path` includes the NetCDF libaries - :file:`/usr/lib64`,  :file:`/usr/lib`.
