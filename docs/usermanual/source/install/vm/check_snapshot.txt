Create a snapshot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While not required, it can be useful to create a snapshot of the virtual machine now and at various other times (say, before a major configuration change). This can help reduce downtime if there is a server issue. We'll start by taking an initial snapshot.

#. Shut down the virtual machine.

#. In the VirtualBox Manager, select the virtual machine  if it isn't already selected, and click the :guilabel:`Snapshots` button on the top right of the console. 

   .. warning:: FIGURE NEEDED

#. Click the :guilabel:`Take Snapshot` button (the camera icon on the left).

   .. warning:: FIGURE NEEDED

#. Enter a snapshot name. For the first snapshot, a good name might be "Initial installation".

   .. warning:: FIGURE NEEDED

#. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

#. Restart the virtual machine.

Reverting to a previous snapshot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should you ever encounter a system error that you are unable to recover from, you can always revert the virtual machine to a recent snapshot and restart the course from that position. **This should only be done if all other troubleshooting options have been exhausted.**

To revert to a previous snapshot:

#. Shut down the virtual machine.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Snapshots` button on the top right of the console. 

   .. warning:: FIGURE NEEDED

#. Click to select the snapshot in the list, then click the :guilabel:`Restore Snapshot` button.

   .. warning:: FIGURE NEEDED

#. The snapshot will be restored, and you can start the virtual machine again.
