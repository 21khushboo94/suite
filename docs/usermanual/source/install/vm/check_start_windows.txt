Start the virtual machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important to test that the virtual machine installed in the previous exercise is running correctly.

#. Start the virtual machine by clicking the :guilabel:`Start` toolbar button.

   .. note:: "Normal Start" will spawn a console window, while "Headless Start" will not. We recommend using "Headless Start" and interacting with the server via a local SSH connection.

      Headless Start

   .. note:: Occasionally, the virtual machine can not be started. In many cases, this can be solved by going into your machine's BIOS and enabling **hardware virtualization**. Please check with your hardware manufacturer for information on how to enable this.

#. If you see any Windows Firewall warnings, you may accept them.

#. It may take a few minutes for the virtual machine to load. You will know that the virtual machine is ready when you see the preview pause and ask for a login:

      Login screen on the preview pane in VirtualBox

   .. note:: If you chose :guilabel:`Normal Start`, a console window will be opened. This window captures keyboard and mouse input, which can be a hindrance to working with the virtual machine.
      
      * If you just see a blank screen, click in the window and press :kbd:`Enter`.

      * If you ever lose your mouse or are unable to type, press the :kbd:`Right Ctrl` key to reclaim focus back from the virtual machine.
    
#. Once you see the above screen, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/dashboard. You should see the Boundless Suite Dashboard.
