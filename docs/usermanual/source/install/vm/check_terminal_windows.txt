Terminal setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most interaction with Boundless Suite will be done through a browser, but occasionally we will want to run commands directly on the virtual machine. To do this, we will use a terminal client.

.. note:: Use :guilabel:`Headless Start` to prevent the virtual machine console from even being shown.

We will use the following connection parameters to connect to the virtual machine via the terminal:

* **Host name**: ``localhost``
* **Port**: ``2020``
* **User**: ``suite``
* **Password**: ``boundless``

For **Windows** systems, we recommend using the `PuTTY <http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe>`_ terminal utility.

#. Double-click ``putty.exe``.

#. In the :guilabel:`Host Name (or IP address)` box, enter :kbd:`localhost`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Port` box, enter :kbd:`2020`.

   .. figure:: /install/include/vbox/img/vbox_puttyconfig.png

      Configuring PuTTY for console access

#. Click :guilabel:`Open`.

#. When asked for a user name, enter :kbd:`suite` and press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. When asked for a password, enter :kbd:`boundless` and press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. Check the shared directory to confirm that files can be shared between the host and the virtual machine:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd /media/sf_share
      ls -l

   You should see the contents of your shared directory.

   .. note:: If you named your shared directory something other than "share", the shared folder will be named :file:`/media/sf_<name>`.
