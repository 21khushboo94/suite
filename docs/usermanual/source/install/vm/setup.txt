These instructions provide a **virtual machine** which has been already configured with Boundless Suite, eliminating the need to install Boundless Suite directly on your machine.

**All interaction with Boundless Suite will still be done through your host's standard browser or a terminal connection.** There is no need to interact directly with the virtual machine console once it is running.

This virtual machine is designed to run inside `VirtualBox <http://virtualbox.com>`_.

.. note:: 

   Prerequisites:

   * Please disable any programs on your system that use either port 2020 or 8080.
   * Make sure you have administrative / super-user privileges on your system.
   * You must be able to run a 64-bit virtual machine. 32-bit machines are not supported.

#. Install `VirtualBox <http://virtualbox.com>`_. You may keep all defaults during the install.

      Accessing the shared folder menu

#. In order to facilitate copying files from your host system to the virtual machine, we recommend creating a shared folder such that any files copied to that folder  will be accessible inside the virtual machine. Right-click the blank area of the dialog and select :guilabel:`Add shared folder` (or press :kbd:`Insert`).
