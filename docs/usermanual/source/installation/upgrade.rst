Upgrading
=========

Minor version upgrades of OpenGeo Suite (defined as from version 4.x to 4.y) can be installed on top of previous versions and all previous data and configuration is preserved.

Major version upgrades (defined as going from version 3.x to 4.y), however, may not preserve data and configuration and require more steps as outlined in the following sections.

.. note::

   For any upgrade it is strongly recommend that you always make a back up before performing the upgrade. 

The general process for performing a major upgrade is as follows.

#. Back up all data and configuration.

#. Uninstall the previous OpenGeo Suite version.

#. Install the new OpenGeo Suite version.

#. Restore data and configuration from the back up.
