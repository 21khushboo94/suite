Composer
=========

Composer is a tool for creating, styling and publishing maps. It runs in the same container as GeoServer, accessible at ``/composer/``. So if GeoServer exists at ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/``, Composer is available at ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/composer/``

.. todo:: Add figure

Composer is available **only with OpenGeo Suite Enterprise**.

For more information about Composer please see the section on :ref:`webmaps.composer`.
