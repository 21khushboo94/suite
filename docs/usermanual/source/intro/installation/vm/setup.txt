These instructions provide a **virtual machine** which has been already configured with Boundless Suite, eliminating the need to install Boundless Suite directly on your machine.

To make things easier, all interaction with Boundless Suite will still be done through your host's standard browser or a terminal connection. **There is no need to interact directly with the virtual machine console once it is running.**

This virtual machine is designed to run inside `VirtualBox <http://virtualbox.com>`_.
