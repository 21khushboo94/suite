=================

This section will highlight some common and useful WPS processes stored in the OpenGeo Suite. It is not a comprehensive listing of all processes; rather, it is designed to get a feel for how some particular processes operate.

Processes are divided up into three categories, based on the type of geospaital content that they operate on:  **vector**, **raster**, and **geometry**.
