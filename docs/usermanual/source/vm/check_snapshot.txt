Create a snapshot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We highly recommend that you create a snapshot of the virtual machine now and at every major milestone of the course (such as at the beginning/end of every module). We'll start by taking an initial snapshot.

.. admonition:: Exercise

   #. Shut down the virtual machine using your terminal application:

      .. code-block:: console

         sudo poweroff

   #. In the VirtualBox Manager, select the Boundless GeoServer VM if it isn't already selected, and click the :guilabel:`Snapshots` button on the top right of the console. 

      .. figure:: /vm/img/vboxwin_snapshotsbutton.png

         Snapshots button

   #. Click the :guilabel:`Take Snapshot` button (the camera icon on the left).

      .. figure:: /vm/img/vboxwin_snapshots.png

         Take Snapshot button

   #. Enter a snapshot name. A useful name would include the current position in the course materials. For example: :kbd:`Beginning of GeoServer I course`

      .. figure:: /vm/img/vboxwin_newsnapshot.png

         Creating a new snapshot

   #. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

   #. Restart the virtual machine.

Repeat this process at the start/end of each module.

Reverting to a previous snapshot
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Should you ever encounter a system error that you are unable to recover from, you can always revert the virtual machine to a recent snapshot and restart the course from that position. **This should only be done if all other troubleshooting options have been exhausted.**

To revert to a previous snapshot:

#. Shut down the virtual machine.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Snapshots` button on the top right of the console. 

   .. figure:: /vm/img/vboxwin_snapshotsbutton.png

      Snapshots button

#. Click to select the snapshot in the list, then click the :guilabel:`Restore Snapshot` button.

   .. figure:: /vm/img/check_restore.png

      Restore snapshot

#. The snapshot will be restored, and you can start the virtual machine again.
