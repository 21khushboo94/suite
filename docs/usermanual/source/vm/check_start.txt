Start the virtual machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important to test that the virtual machine installed in the previous exercise is running correctly.

#. Start the virtual machine by clicking the :menuselection:`Start --> Headless Start` toolbar button (or by using the application menu :menuselection:`Machine --> Start --> Headless Start`).

      Starting the virtual machine

   .. note:: Occasionally, the virtual machine can not be started. In most of these cases, this can be solved by going into your machine's BIOS and enabling **hardware virtualization**. Please check with your hardware manufacturer for information on how to enable this.

#. It may take a few minutes for the virtual machine to load. You will know that the virtual machine is ready when you see the preview pause and ask for a login:

   .. note::
      
      If you accidentally used :guilabel:`Normal Start` instead of :guilabel:`Headless Start`, a console window will be opened. This window captures keyboard and mouse input, which can be a hindrance to working with the virtual machine.
      
      * If you just see a blank screen, click in the window, press :kbd:`Enter`

      * If you ever lose your mouse or are unable to type, press the :kbd:`Right Ctrl` key to reclaim focus back from the virtual machine.
    
      We recommend not interacting with this window, but instead using a terminal connection, described below.

#. Once you see the above screen, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/dashboard. You should see the Boundless Suite Dashboard.
