Terminal setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most interaction with Boundless Suite will be done through a browser, but occasionally we will want to run commands directly on the virtual machine. To do this, we will use a terminal client.

.. note:: Do not log in directly to the virtual machine console. Using :guilabel:`Headless Start` will prevent the virtual machine console from even being shown.

We will use the following connection parameters to connect to the virtual machine via the terminal:

* **Host name**: ``localhost``
* **Port**: ``2020``
* **User**: ``suite``
* **Password**: (blank)

For **Windows** systems, we recommend using the **PuTTY** terminal utility.

#. Download `PuTTY <http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe>`_.

#. Double-click ``putty.exe``.

#. In the :guilabel:`Host Name (or IP address)` box, enter :kbd:`localhost`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Port` box, enter :kbd:`2020`.

   .. figure:: /vm/img/setup_putty.png

      PuTTY connection parameters

#. Click :guilabel:`Open`.

#. When asked for a user name, enter :kbd:`training` and leave the password blank.

#. Check the shared directory to confirm that files can be shared between the host and the virtual machine:

.. code-block:: console

   cd /media/sf_share
   ls -l

You should see the contents of your shared directory.

.. note:: If you named your shared directory something other than "share", the shared folder will be named :file:`/media/sf_<name>`.
