Setup and Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These instructions provide a **virtual machine** which has been already configured with Boundless Suite, eliminating the need to install Boundless Suite directly on your machine.

To make things easier, all interaction with Boundless Suite will still be done through your host's standard browser or a terminal connection. **There is no need to interact directly with the virtual machine console once it is running.**

.. _VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Prerequisites:

* Please disable any programs on your system that use either port 2020 or 8080. (If this is not possible, please ask for alternative connection options.)
* We strongly recommend you use a recent version of `Firefox <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`_ as the browser on your host system. Using `Chrome <https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/>`_ is acceptable, though an XML viewer extension such as `XV <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xv-%E2%80%94-xml-viewer/eeocglpgjdpaefaedpblffpeebgmgddk?hl=en>`_ will be useful for previewing XML and JSON output.
* Make sure you have administrative rights (Windows) or super-user privileges (Linux and OS X) on your system.

Next we will install the Boundless Suite virtual machine. This virtual machine will run inside `VirtualBox`_ in the background of your system.

#. Download the `Boundless Suite 4.9 virtual machine`_:

   .. note:: You must be able to run a 64-bit virtual machine. 32-bit machines are not supported.

#. Download and install the latest `VirtualBox`_. You may keep all defaults during the install.

      Installing VirtualBox for Windows

   .. note:: During install on Windows, you may see a warning about your network interfaces. **This is expected.** Your network connections will be *temporarily* disconnected, and automatically reset after installation has completed. So be aware that you don't want to be utilizing your network connection (for example, downloading something) during the installation of VirtualBox.

#. Double-click the VM image file that you downloaded above (with the :file:`.ova` file extension). This will import the virtual machine into VirtualBox.

      Importing the virtual machine into VirtualBox

#. You will now see the :guilabel:`Boundless Suite` entry in the list of virtual machines in VirtualBox.

#. Click to select the virtual machine and then click :guilabel:`Shared Folders`.

#. In order to facilitate copying files from your host system to the virtual machine, we recommend creating a shared folder such that any files copied there will be accessible inside the virtual machine. Right-click the blank area of the dialog and select :guilabel:`Add shared folder` (or press :kbd:`Insert`).

      Right-click to add a new shared folder

#. Fill out the form:

   * For :guilabel:`Folder Path`, select a directory that will serve as the shared folder. One good option for this directory would be the desktop (:file:`C:\\Users\\<username>\\Desktop`).
   * For :guilabel:`Folder Name`, enter :kbd:`share`. 
   * Check :guilabel:`Auto-mount`.
