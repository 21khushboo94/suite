Creating web apps with Web SDK
==============================

Web SDK is used to JavaScript-based web mapping applications backed by Boundless Suite.
It makes use of the `JavaScript React framework <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`_ to provide modular components, which can be used to create complete web mapping applications with only a few lines of code.

.. attention:: Web SDK is coming soon. Currently, only the Web SDK Quickview demo application is available.

Install Web SDK
---------------

Web SDK can be obtained from `Boundless Connect <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com>`_.

Demo Applications
-----------------

Boundless Suite includes Web SDK QuickView, a demo application build using Web SDK. QuickView is a basic map viewer that can be used to view and create layers and maps. QuickView is accessible at ``http://localhost:8080/quickview/``.
