Making maps with Composer
=========================

OpenGeo Suite Composer is a tool for making web maps. Add data to GeoServer, publish layers, and make a map all in a clutter-free, easy-to-use interface.

Also included only with Composer is the ability to style layers with :ref:`YSLD <cartography.ysld>`, a compact, modern syntax that's 100% compatible with SLD.
