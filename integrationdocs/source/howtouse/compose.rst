Now that you have your data imported and styled, you can now organize your layers and compose them into a finished map.  GeoExplorer allows creation of web mapping applications based on layers served through GeoServer.

#. Run GeoExplorer.  You can do this by going to the :menuselection:`Start Menu --> Programs --> OpenGeo Suite --> GeoExplorer --> GeoExplorer` or by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080/geoserver/www/GeoExplorer .
