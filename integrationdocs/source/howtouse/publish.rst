Publish Your Map
================

After you have created and composed your map, you can publish it via either a URL bookmark or by embedding it in a webpage.

URL Bookmark
------------

To generate a URL bookmark:

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Bookmark` icon.

   .. figure:: img/bookmarkbutton.png
      :align: center

      *The Bookmark button will generate a URL*

#. A URL will be displayed.  Copy and save this URL to regenerate this map at a later time.

      :align: center

      *Copy this URL to save your map*
 
Embedded HTML
-------------

To embed your map in a web page:

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Publish Map` icon.

   .. figure:: img/publishmapbutton.png
      :align: center

      *The Publish Map button will generate a block of HTML*

#. In the dialog box that follows, select the layers that you wish to include in this embedded map.  (If you have already composed your map, you do not need to change anything here.)  Click :guilabel:`Next` to continue.

   .. figure:: img/exportmapdialog1.png
      :align: center

      *Selecting the layers for the map export*

#. The next screen will show HTML code that can be copied and included in a web page to embed the map.  You can change the values for the map size in the :guilabel:`Map Size` pulldown box, or by changing the :guilabel:`Height` and :guilabel:`Width` values.  The changes will automatically be reflected in the HTML.
