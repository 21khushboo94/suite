What Is The OpenGeo Suite?
==========================

The OpenGeo Suite is a free, fully-featured web mapping environment that's easy to install, configure, and use, allowing you to create maps quickly, easily, and painlessly.

This package includes the following components:

* **GeoServer** - A software server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data.
* **GeoServer Data Importer** - An extension to GeoServer that allows for bulk importing of shapefiles.
* **Styler** - Allows for graphical styling of geospatial layers.
* **GeoExplorer** - Allows for creating a browser-based mapping application from saved layers.

Styler and GeoExplorer are applications based on `GeoExt <http://geoext.org>`_.
