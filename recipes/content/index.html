            These recipes provides samples and examples of how to use The OpenGeo Suite.  Use the 'Search' functionality to find relevant code snippets to use in your applications.

            <p>Each recipe is a working example of some functionality of The OpenGeo Suite, with links to relevant documentation as well as a 'Source' tab to easily copy and paste the code.  We expect each recipe to be a starting point for creating your own application.  They are designed as discrete pieces of functionality.  Future recipes will show how to combine various components together.</p>

            <p>While some recipes only make use of one component of the OpenGeo Suite many rely on various parts working together.  To learn more about the Suite you can dig in to the full documentation (link to docs for each) for each project.  OpenGeo also offers training on the Suite, individually and as part of Enterprise Edition packages.  Future versions of the Suite will include Creative Commons licensed workshop material.  In the meantime there is material available at OpenGeo's <a href="http://workshops.opengeo.org">Education Center</a>.</p>
