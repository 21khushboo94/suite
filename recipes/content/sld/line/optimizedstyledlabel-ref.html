        <h1>Optimized Styled Label</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example improves the style of optimally-placed labels
        </div>
        <div class="content">
           This example is similar to the Optimized label placement example. The only difference is in the font information, which is contained in lines 15-20. Line 16 sets the font family to be "Arial", line 17  sets the font size to 10, line 18 sets the font style to "normal" (as opposed to "italic" or "oblique"), and line 19  sets the font weight to "bold" (as opposed to "normal").</p>
           
           <p>Note: This example uses options that are specific to GeoServer and are not part of the SLD 1.0 specification.</p>
