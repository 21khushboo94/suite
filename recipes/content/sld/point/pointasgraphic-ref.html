This example styles each point as a graphic instead of as a simple shape.</div>
        <div class="content">
            This style uses a graphic instead of a simple shape to render the points. In SLD, this is known as an &lt; ExternalGraphic&gt;, to distinguish it from the commonly-used shapes such as squares and circles that are internal to the renderer. Lines 5-10 specify the details of this graphic. Line 8 sets the path and file name of the graphic, while line 9 indicates the format (MIME type) of the graphic (image/png). In this example, the graphic is contained in the same directory as the SLD, so no path information is necessary in line 8, although a full URL could be used if desired. Line 11 determines the size of the displayed graphic; this can be set independently of the dimensions of the graphic itself, although in this case they are the same (32 pixels). Should a graphic be rectangular, the <Size> value will apply to the height of the graphic only, with the width scaled proportionally.
