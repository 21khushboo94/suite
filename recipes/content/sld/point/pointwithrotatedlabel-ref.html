        <h1>Point with Rotated Label Documentation</h1>
        <div class="description">
This example builds on the previous example, Point with styled label, by rotating the label by 45 degrees, positioning the labels farther away from the points, and changing the color of the label to purple.</div>
        <div class="content">
            This example is similar to the Point with styled label, but there are three important differences. Line 32 specifies 25 pixels of vertical displacement. Line 34 specifies a rotation of "-45" or 45 degrees counter-clockwise. (Rotation values increase clockwise, which is why the value is negative.) Finally, line 38 sets the font color to be a shade of purple (#99099). 
            
            <p>Note that the displacement takes effect before the rotation during rendering, so in this example, the 25 pixel vertical displacement is itself rotated 45 degrees.</p>
