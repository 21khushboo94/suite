        <h1>Point with Styled Label Documentation</h1>
        <div class="description">
This example improves the label style from the Point with default label example by centering the label above the point and providing a different font name and size.</div>
        <div class="content">
            In this example, lines 3-13 are identical to the Simple point example above. The &lt;TextSymbolizer&gt; on lines 14-39 contains many more details about the label styling than the previous example, Point with default label. Lines 15-17 once again specify the "name" attribute as text to display. Lines 18-23 set the font information: line 19 sets the font family to be "Arial", line 20 sets the font size to 12, line 21 sets the font style to "normal" (as opposed to "italic" or "oblique"), and line 22 sets the font weight to "bold" (as opposed to "normal"). Lines 24-35 (&lt;LabelPlacement&gt;) determine the placement of the label relative to the point. The &lt;AnchorPoint&gt; (lines 26-29) sets the point of intersection between the label and point, which here (line 27-28) sets the point to be centered (0.5) horizontally axis and bottom aligned (0.0) vertically with the label. There is also <Displacement> (lines 30-33), which sets the offset of the label relative to the line, which in this case is 0 pixels horizontally (line 31) and 5 pixels vertically (line 32). Finally, line 37 sets the font color of the label to black (#000000).

            The result is a centered bold label placed slightly above each point.
