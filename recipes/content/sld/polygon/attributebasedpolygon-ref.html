        <h1>Attribute-based Polygon</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example styles the polygons differently based on the "pop" (Population) attribute.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Each polygon in our fictional country has a population that is represented by the population ("pop") attribute. This style contains three rules that alter the fill based on the value of "pop" attribute, with smaller values yielding a lighter color and larger values yielding a darker color.

          <p>The three rules are designed as follows:</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Rule order</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Rule name / type</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Population ("pop")</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Color</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>SmallPop</td>
              <td>Less than 200,000</td>
              <td>#66FF66</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>MediumPop</td>
              <td>200,000 to 500,000</td>
              <td>#33CC33</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>LargePop</td>
              <td>Greater than 500,000</td>
              <td>#009900</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>The order of the rules does not matter in this case, since each shape is only rendered by a single rule.</p>

          <p>The first rule, on lines 2-16, specifies the styling of polygons whose population attribute is less than 200,000. Lines 5-10 set this filter, with lines 6-9 setting the "less than" filter, line 7 denoting the attribute ("pop"), and line 8 the value of 200,000. The color of the polygon fill is set to a light green (#66FF66) on line 13.</p>

          <p>The second rule, on lines 17-37, is similar, specifying a style for polygons whose population attribute is greater than or equal to 200,000 but less than 500,000. The filter is set on lines 20-31. This filter is longer than in the first rule because two criteria need to be specified instead of one: a "greater than or equal to" and a "less than" filter. Notice the And on line 21 and line 30. This mandates that both filters need to be true for the rule to be applicable. The color of the polygon fill is set to a medium green on (#33CC33) on line 34.</p>

          <p>The third rule, on lines 38-52, specifies a style for polygons whose population attribute is greater than or equal to 500,000. The filter is set on lines 41-46. The color of the polygon fill is the only other difference in this rule, which is set to a dark green (#009900) on line 49.</p>
