        <div class="content">
            This style fills the polygon with a tiled graphic. This is known as an &lt; ExternalGraphic&gt;  in SLD, to distinguish it from commonly-used shapes such as squares and circles that are "internal" to the renderer. Lines 7-12  specify details for the graphic, with line 10 setting the path and file name of the graphic and line 11 indicating the file format (MIME type) of the graphic (image/png). Although a full URL could be specified if desired, no path information is necessary in line 11 because this graphic is contained in the same directory as the SLD. Line 13 determines the height of the displayed graphic in pixels; if the value differs from the height of the graphic then it will be scaled accordingly while preserving the aspect ratio.
