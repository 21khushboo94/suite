        <h1>Label Halo</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example alters the look of a default label by adding a white halo to the label.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          This example is similar to the Polygon with Default Label, with the addition of a halo around the labels on lines 16-21. A halo creates a color buffer around the label to improve label legibility. Line 17 sets the radius of the halo, extending the halo 3 pixels around the edge of the label, and line 19 sets the color of the halo to white (#FFFFFF). Since halos are most useful when set to a sharp contrast relative to the text color, this example uses a white halo around black text to ensure optimum readability.
