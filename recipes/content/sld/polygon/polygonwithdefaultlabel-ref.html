        <h1>Polygon with Default Label</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example shows a text label on the polygon. In the absence of any other customization, this is how a label will be displayed.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            In this example there is a <PolygonSymbolizer> and a <TextSymbolizer>. Lines 3-11 comprise the <PolygonSymbolizer>. The fill of the polygon is set on line 5 to a light green (#40FF40) while the stroke of the polygon is set on lines 8-9 to white (#FFFFFF) with a thickness of 2 pixels. The label is set in the <TextSymbolizer> on lines 12-16, with line 14 determining what text to display, in this case the value of the "name" attribute. All other details about the label are set to the renderer default, which here is Times New Roman font, font color black, and font size of 10 pixels.
